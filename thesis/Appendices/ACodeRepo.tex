\lhead{Appendix A. \emph{Overview about submitted code}} % This is for the header on each page - perhaps a shortened title

The created code and configuration file was uploaded to the project GitHub repository. The repository has private access only. Access to the repository can be granted by request.

The GitHub repository is located at: \href{https://github.com/pth68/SimulationPlatform}{https://github.com/pth68/SimulationPlatform}

The location of the additional files that are relevant for creation of the cluster are located in the \mbox{\textbf{"Distribution"}} sub directory of the repository. 
\autoref{tbl:appdx.coderepo} describes the submitted files (relative from the "Distribution" directory) and their intention.
