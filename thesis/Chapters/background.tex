\section{Baseline architecture}
The current system design consists of multiple levels.



\section{Problem statement}
The existing application is clearly based on a microservice architecture.  However, it is not able to run on a distributed system yet. It consists of multiple processes that have to run on the same system and need a full working operating system as baseline. Containerization of the system has never been tested (erprobt) and needs to be introduced. 
% Automatic service extension = Automatische erweiterung der Services auf neuen Nodes
Additionally, the automatic service extension requires communication between the cluster orchestration management and the applications running on the nodes.

Regarding logging, while the frontend application does, the microservices currently do not produce log files. Instead, all sub processes write the information on its standard output stream.
