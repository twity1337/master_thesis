\section{Analysis}

\section{Known issues and pitfalls}

- Containerfile support differs from Dockerfile: Path of ENTRYPOINT is not treated the same way.
- K8s Documentation redirects to a different page when searching for tutorial for adding windows nodes
- Error messages of Windows hcs shim are not explanatory

- Windows needs to have certain Update installed to run flannel container

- Windows base image has to have same build number than host computer (not the same in linux containers)

- Scripts and docs are maintained by a relatively small community (SIG windows tools)

- Cluster networking throws weird error messages when performed inside hyper-v vm ("Directory not found")

- Docker support was removed, containerd is not fully supported yet (without bugs) in Windows
